UnSF is a tool to convert SoundFont (sf2) files into GUS patches.  

libunsf is a library that is used by UnSF.

Some reasons you might want to do such a thing are: 
 * Your midi player can use GUS patches but doesn't know how to read
 soundfonts
 * You want a convenient way of substituting patches or reassigning
 banks of instruments by editing GUS config files
 * You need to modify patches by changing amplitude, stripping
 envelopes, or make other changes that can easily be done by attaching
 options in config files.

History
=======

unsf.c is derived from the Allegro tool pat2dat.c, and uses, presumably,
the part of that program which was written originally by George Foot.
Also, some code is adapted from routines in sndfont.c. All of which was
original under the Allegro "beerware" license.
